# Getting Started with Metron

## Introduction

Apache Metron is a cybersecurity pipeline platform that ingests network activity and assesses the potential threat levelof these events. Metron is more adaptable than a standard rule based system because it profiles normal user activity and responding to activity that is abnormal for a specific user type. Enrichments can be added to the events to create a more robust record and are completely configurable by the Metron user.

This tutorial will show you how to open and navigate the Metron UIs and gives you an understanding of the information each shows.
